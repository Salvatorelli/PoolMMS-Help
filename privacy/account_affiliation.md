# Affiliating Your PoolMMS Account with an Organization

Affiliating your PoolMMS account with an organization (or swim club) allows the organization to access certain information associated with your account. In this article, we will discuss what it means to affiliate your account with an organization and what information the organization can access.

## What Information Can an Organization Access?

When you affiliate your account with an organization, the organization will have access to your first and last name, email address, phone number, and other account details. This includes information such as the time your account was created, the IP address associated with the account, and the last time you logged in. However, it is important to note that organizations will not have access to information from other organizations.

## Can You Remove Your Affiliation with an Organization?

Once you affiliate your account with an organization, you cannot remove the affiliation without contacting the organization or PoolMMS support. This is because the organization relies on this information to manage their members, and removing your affiliation could result in loss of data or inaccurate reporting.

## What Policies Apply to Your Information?

Your information is subject to the terms of service for PoolMMS, which can be found at https://poolmms.com/pages/terms, as well as the privacy policy, which can be found at https://poolmms.com/pages/privacy. Additionally, your information is subject to the policies of the organization with which you are affiliated.
