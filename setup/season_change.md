# How to Prepare PoolMMS for the Next Season

Follow these steps to prepare your organization's PoolMMS account for the upcoming season:

1. **Login to PoolMMS as an Admin** by going to [https://PoolMMS.com/gohome](https://PoolMMS.com/gohome).   
   *Note: If a user is affiliated with multiple organizations they must pick the correct one.*

2. In the Admin sidebar under **Club Administration** select **Settings**.  
   *Note: If you do not see this option, your account may not have the access level required to access this. Please contact your organization's administrator.*
   *Note: If your organization is not a "Club" the section may be labeled something else, for example "Association Administration".*

3. On the right sidebar select **End/Start of Season Actions** or scroll down until you see these options.

4. Click **Deactivate ALL Members** and wait for the action to complete. This may take a minute.  
   *Note: Once this step is complete, all members will be marked as inactive, and their ID cards will no longer be functional.*

5. Click **Reset ALL Welcome Emails** and wait for the action to complete. This may take a minute.  
   *Note: Once this step is complete, PoolMMS will be ready to send welcome emails to members for the next season.*

6. Click **Cleanup Families** and wait for the action to complete. This may take a minute.  
   *Note: Once this step is complete, all families will be cleaned up to allow new information to be imported, or new registrations to take place.*

7. (Optional) Click **Deactivate ALL Bands** and wait for the action to complete. This may take a minute.  
   *Note: This will revoke all swim bands issued in the past season. If your organization requires members and guests retake their band tests it is essential you do this.*

8. If your organization uses the CRM, **deactivate all current registrations and set up registrations for the next season**.
